            <h2>The Retrograde - Fire Betty's Flyer</h2>
            <p>This is a project I worked on for another band called The Retrograde. I've had the opportunity to work on a few projects with this awesome band as well. This was the first project I did with them. Their goals were to create a Flyer design that matches with their retro, pop art, and vintage vibe that would be consistent with a lot of their album cover work. They were super excited to see how this turned out and I was very happy to have pleased the band with this flyer</p>
