            <h2>The Retrograde - The Hummingbird Flyer</h2>
            <p>After being able to satisfy this band with out first project, they reached out for another show flyer just a couple weeks later. They wanted to go with the same kind of retro vibe as before but with a different twist. I did, however, face some obstacles with fitting this information, but it ended up falling in place and the band was very happy once again, which, as always, is a very good feeling when being a designer.</p>
