            <h2>3rd & Linsdley Flyer - Hippies & Cowboys</h2>
            <p>This is a recent project I had the honor to work on for my wonderful client, a band from Nashville, TN called Hippies and Cowboys. We have been working together very often for the past year or so and I've had many special opportunities to create some great graphic work with these guys. This flyer was a bit of a last minute one, but luckily I was sitting on some unused graphics and this one ended up being perfect for the flyer and fitting all the necessary information for the event. I had a lot of fun working on this and the band was stoked to see how it turned out!</p>
