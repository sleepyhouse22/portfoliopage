            <h2>Vietnam Vertans Organization Flyer</h2>
            <p>This was yet another amazing project I got to work on with the great Hippies & Cowboys band. This was for an event for the Howard County Vietnam Veterans Organization, which is an event they play each year and going into this project, they made it clear with me how important this event is for them to play annually. With that said, I really wanted to be sure I would drive home the idea that this event will be honoring this country and those who fought so hard for our freedom. Again, the band was very pleased with the turnout of this piece. I had a lot of fun bringing these ideas to life.</p>
