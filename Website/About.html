My name is Caden Hanneman, a graphic designer from Denver, Colorado. I was born and raised here in denver. through the entirety of my life, I've always has a passion for art in many different mediums. Since a kid, I've always loved exploring my mind and what can be done within the realm of art, given how vast of a subject matter it is. Growing up, I would often draw and do paintings, when I would later begin to delve a bit into digital design and digital artwork. Ever since March 2021, I've been taking my work in the graphic design field much more seriously. This was when I began to do freelance work and have ever since satisfied hundreds of brands, businesses, and bands through my design work. I take a lot of passion in the work I create and leaving my customers satisfied is my number one priority. Head over to the "Contact" tab and apply to work with me today!
