            <h2>Atlanta Rhythm Section Flyer</h2>
            <p>This was another project that actually came to me through the same band as before, Hippies and Cowboys. This flyer was for their upcoming summer show with the band Atlanta Rhythm Section, which is a pretty widely know band and that really made this a special opportunity, as well as something that I really wanted to ensure would be very eye grabbing for any viewer of this poster, while also still displaying all of the necessary information in an effective way, visually.</p>
